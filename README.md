# OLA1_-DB
Our frontend is displayed with HTML and JS.
To view the content from the database in the frontend, the backend (Node.js) has to be active.
The command for running the backend is "node server.mjs". (Must be runned inside frontend_v2 folder)

A Neo4j database has to be established with these credentials:
- Username neo4j
- Password abcd1234

You will have to create a new database in the DBMS called dbmain

After these procedures are done, you can run the entire notebook to persist the relevant data for the frontend.
